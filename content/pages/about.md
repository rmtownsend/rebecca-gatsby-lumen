Hello! I am an information management professional with a background in library and information science. Currently, I work at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I work with teams throughout the organization on projects related to information management, knowledge capture, taxonomy and ontology development, and enterprise search. I have professional experience in libraries, archives, museums, and ice cream production.

When I’m not thinking about how to make all the things findable, I enjoy hiking, yoga, home fermentation, learning to code, and [making things with yarn](https://lambandllama.com/).
