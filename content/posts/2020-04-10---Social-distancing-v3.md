Four weeks into mandatory work from home.
Three weeks into California's and LA's Safer at Home orders.
One week into suggested mask wearing, and a day into mandatory mask wearing.
It's becoming clear that a return to "normal" is an uncertain but long time away. And as the uncertainty increases, a new public health concern emerges--mental health.

### Confession

I will be honest. Even in the Before Times, I struggled with anxiety and depression. It hasn't been problematic enough for me to seek help since high school, when I had an eating disorder that brought me down to "hospital weight" and I didn't have much choice (though I was never hospitalized). My mental health has fluctuated in the more than a decade since I first saw a therapist, but the monsters of anxiety, depression, and even disordered eating have certainly reared their heads plenty of times since then.

Recently, I've trended towards anxiety. It's only in the past year or two that I would begin to describe myself as an anxious person. Previously, I would experience anxiety around particular activities--social situations, public speaking, track races. Since then, I've gotten much better at both social situations and public speaking (I'm fine with not running in circles), but I'm also, frequently, anxious about everything, especially at work. I am a worrier. It's something I'm quite good at. Need someone to think up all the things that could go wrong or the ways people might be upset at you? I'm your girl. I do all the things that make me anxious because I have no choice, it all does.

### The Current Situation

In some ways, this has prepared me well for the Current Situation (somehow I've adopted this tendency to avoid saying coronavirus or COVID, as if it is Voldemort or some other evil not to be named). To everyone else who is feeling daily anxiety: hello! Welcome to my world! For the first few weeks, the Current Situation was, surprisingly, not manifesting in an especially large amount of anxiety. I had bad days, but no more than normal.

Don't worry. That has changed. Anxiety has returned, and brought depression along for the ride.

My eyes poured tears yesterday. I should have run out of them, they flooded so freely and for so long. I was late to a (Webex) meeting because I could. not. stop. crying. I panicked doing laundry in our apartment's shared laundry room, I had a breakdown cooking dinner tonight, I was up until midnight sobbing, moving from one worry to the next. Work. Illness. Family. Food. Work. Illness. Family. Food. Sleep has been restless, not only for me but for my partner, who is usually the epitome of calm to all my neuroses. If he's anxious, we know it's bad.

### Not alone

We're not the only ones. The LA Times published an article about [depression and coronavirus](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-17/column-coronavirus-depression) back in mid-March, before many of the current restrictions were in place and before most of us had a sense for how long this might last. The New York Times has published articles about [how the pandemic may leave us feeling scatterbrained](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/quarantine-mental-health-gender.html) and [how exercise may be a treatment for anxiety, depression, and anger](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/well/move/coronavirus-exercise-depression-anxiety-mood.html).

It doesn't help that some of the things that might normally help us cope are off limits. Going for a walk or a run is a challenge when going outside feels like a risk, and parks in LA and throughout California are closed. The social networks that are so important to bringing us out of the darkness feel more distant than ever.

### What to do

It's tempting to cope by working harder than ever. You never leave the office when the office is your studio apartment, and what else are you going to do, anyway? But that approach is not sustainable. My supervisor shared an article from the Chronicle of Higher Education called [Why You Should Ignore All That Coronavirus-Inspired Productivity Pressure](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-You-Should-Ignore-All-That/248366), which highlights the pitfalls of avoiding coming to terms with the crisis by diving headfirst into work, and provides actionable suggestions for where we should direct our focus to establish security in the crisis, not so that we can boost productivity or pretend we're back in the Before Times, but so that we can accept and adjust to our new normal, establish reasonable expectations for ourselves, and find space for hope and resilience.

This will guide my to do list for the weekend. Restock on food. Call some friends and my parents. Let go of the things I think I should learn and do "now that I have time." Get outside if I can, but be easy on myself if I can't. Let go of my urge to control, which in the absence of power to control the Current Situation, has been circling dangerously around my perennial coping mechanism: controlling what I eat. It's time to turn to my monsters, give them a hug, and let them go. Sit with my fear and my grief, and then let them go.
