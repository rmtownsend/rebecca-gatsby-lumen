Welcome! I'm glad you're here.

### A little about me

You can read about me on my [about page](/pages/about), but for this blog's(?) inaugural post, here's a more personal intro.

My name is Rebecca. I grew up in small, woodsy town in New Jersey, went to college in Philadelphia, and have spent the past six and a half years in Los Angeles. Currently, I work as an Information Management Engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Though my career trajectory was bumpy at times, I'm thankful for the opportunities I had along my circuitous route. I learned a lot from for working minimum wage, from customer service, and from making ice cream, and all of those experiences have served me in ways I never would have expected.

Having earned my MLIS with the intention of becoming a librarian, my current job is also not quite what I expected, but it's challenging, and though sometimes frustrating, also fulfilling. I work with the best people. I am fascinated by the puzzle of how to capture, organize, and future-proof information in a place as complex and idiosyncratic as JPL. In a fairly non-technical role in a technical place, I've become aware of both my shortcomings (perceived and actual) and my unique skills and perspectives. This has been a catalyst for my desire to expand my skillset. Not quite ready to build a rover yet, but hey, I made a website!

Outside of work, I enjoy activities that allow me to think about my work in a new way, to think about something else, or to not think at all. I love hiking in and around LA, and exploring the incredible mountains and deserts of California. I'm a lapsed runner and a sometimes-yogi. I like reading, and while I resisted getting a Kindle for years, I've read more in the year and half since I've purchased one than I had for a long while before, largely thanks to  [LAPL's](https://www.lapl.org/) vast collection of ebooks. I eat mostly plant-based and love cooking, baking, and experimenting with fermented foods. I like my coffee black and my chocolate as dark as possible.

### About this site

This site was built using the gatsby starter [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) and was deployed on Netlify. It has been, and continues to be, a process and a struggle. I'm learning to code in bits and pieces, and often bite off more than I can chew. I often lack the patience to read documentation and instead just hack away and break things until they work how I'd like them to, to varying degrees of success. I'm working on that patience thing.

My original intention was simply to have a personal and professional website that gave me a web presence. I also want to learn how to make websites, and what better way to learn than by doing? Beyond some about and contact info, I'm not sure what I need here. I actually tried to remove the blog feed entirely and set a page as the index, but failed miserably and gave up (for now), so hi, hello, here's a blog post. I would like to use this site to showcase new digital projects when I have them, and maybe I'll give the writing thing a shot after all, and try to develop my voice as well as my technical savvy.

Until then, welcome. Feel free to send tips, (constructive) criticism, and hellos through my [contact page](/pages/contact).
