Hello! I am an information management professional with a background in library and information science. Currently, I work at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I develop and implement best practices related to information management, knowledge capture, taxonomy and ontology development, and enterprise search. I have professional experience in libraries, archives, museums, and ice cream production. I’m interested in enterprise content management, personal information management, enterprise search, and information literacy.

When I’m not thinking about how to make all the things findable, I enjoy hiking, yoga, home fermentation, learning to code, and eating ice cream.
